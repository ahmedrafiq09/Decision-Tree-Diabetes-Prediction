## Diabetes Prediction using Decision Trees

### Description:
Diabetes Prediction using Decision Trees is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. Leveraging the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, this project utilizes a decision tree classifier to analyze features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and others to determine the probability of a person having diabetes.

### Key Features:

 - Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The dataset is thoroughly explored to understand its structure and characteristics. Necessary preprocessing steps are applied to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

 - Model Training: A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset to build a predictive model. The algorithm learns patterns from the features to make accurate predictions regarding the presence or absence of diabetes.

 - Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in predicting diabetes.

 - Prediction: Users can input their health metrics, and the trained model will predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the provided information. This feature can be utilized for early detection and proactive management of diabetes.

### Technologies Used:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
